        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
         My yoga journey began as a personal practice — a way to reconnect with my body, calm my mind, and find balance in a busy life. What started on the mat soon became something much deeper. Over time, yoga evolved into a way of living with greater awareness, inner strength, and compassion — not only for myself, but for others as well.
          <br><br>
          Through consistent personal practice, I began to notice how yoga positively influenced my everyday life. It helped me stay grounded and focused in a demanding office environment, approach challenges with more clarity, and manage stress with greater ease. Beyond work, yoga has supported me in cultivating patience, presence, and deeper connection in my relationships with my loved ones — reminding me to listen, breathe, and respond with intention rather than reaction. 
          <br><br>
          Inspired by these transformations, teaching yoga grew naturally from my own experience. I completed my teacher training certification with YogaLife International, deepening both my knowledge and my commitment to sharing this practice with others. I love creating classes that are grounding yet energising, accessible yet empowering — where students feel safe, supported, and encouraged to explore their own practice.
          <br><br>
          My intention is to hold a warm and welcoming space where breath, movement, and mindfulness come together — helping students build strength, find balance, and reconnect with themselves, both on and off the mat.

      <div class="about container">
        <h2>Teaching Styles</h2>
        <p>
        My teaching style is rooted in Hatha yoga, with a fluid Vinyasa influence. I focus on mindful alignment, breath-led movement, and creating a practice that feels both steady and dynamic — supporting strength, mobility, and deeper inner awareness.
          <br><br>
          At times, I enjoy gently challenging my students, inviting them to step slightly outside their comfort zone. I often combine traditional yoga postures with conscious breathing, as well as periods of more strength-building movement, to help develop stability, endurance, and confidence in the body. These challenges are always offered with options and modifications, encouraging students to listen to their own limits while exploring their potential.
            <br><br>
          I teach mainly outdoor classes, where nature becomes part of the practice. The open air and relaxed environment create a sense of freedom and connection, allowing each practice to feel grounding yet uplifting. My classes are inclusive and welcoming — open to everyone, regardless of experience — and guided with care, encouragement, and respect for each individual journey.
            <br><br>   
         My intention is to create a supportive and inspiring space where students can feel strong, present, and balanced — leaving the mat not only physically energised, but mentally calm and centred.

                     I truly love the yoga classes with Thea. Her teaching is thoughtful, clear, and deeply supportive, creating a space where it feels easy to relax and fully enjoy the practice. Each session feels well structured and thoughtfully guided, allowing me to really connect with my practice and inner self. Highly recommended.

                        <p>From the very first moment you interact with Thea you feel her positive energy. She creates a safe, calming, and motivating space that makes every session a real pleasure.  I have been practicing yoga with her for over a year now, and her combination of well-structured exercises with soft, encouraging guidance is truly powerful and keeps you engaged throughout the practice. I’ve seen firsthand how uplifting and effective her classes are, and I wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone looking to start or deepen their yoga journey.
